# Dependencies versions, the versions are based on CMS 0057 regulation implementation across all DaVinci guides
The ImplementationGuide uses package hl7.fhir.uv.smart-app-launch#2.1.0 released on 2023-04-18, but the most recent appropriate version is 2.2.0. This reference is getting old and the more recent version should be considered

# These have been presented to CPG per the ticket : https://jira.hl7.org/browse/FHIR-43113. Motion: Linda Michaelsen/Yan Heras : 20-0-0  
US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Coverage derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

The slice 'CLIA' on path 'Organization.identifier' is not marked as 'must-support' which is not consistent with the element that defines the slicing, where 'must-support' is true

The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated
The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/regex|5.2.0 is deprecated with the note This was deprecated in favor of using a constraint on the element using FHIRPath, since constraints allow for the provision of a human readable message associated with the regex



# Future THO Warnings: The IG has limited production implementations and has not reached FMM Level 3 as of yet, so these code systems will be targeted to moved to THO as the IG matures.
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# US Core Inherited Warnings
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
