# These are DaVinci specific template warnings
DA VINCI: The Change Log page (changes.html) does not include any Jira tracker items links for the section with title Release 0.1.0
DA VINCI: This IG does not include an explicit dependency on US Core 3.1.1.

# Future THO Warnings: The IG has limited production implementations and has not reached FMM Level 3 as of yet, so these code systems will be targeted to moved to THO as the IG matures.

Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# US Core Inherited Warnings
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
