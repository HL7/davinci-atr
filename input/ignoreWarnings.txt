# These are DaVinci specific template warnings

# Future THO Warnings
Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# US Core Inherited Warnings
The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
